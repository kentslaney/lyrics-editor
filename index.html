<code>/</code> represents a stressed syllable, <!-- newline to make clearer -->
<code>X</code> represents an unstressed syllable. <!-- while editing src -->
Some words have multiple pronunciations. If a syllable can either be stressed
or not depending on the pronunciation chosen, the meter is instead marked as
<code>\</code>. A number in parentheses (eg <code>{0}</code>) at the end of a
word specifies a pronunciation. When matching a word with its pronunciation,
only letters and <code>'</code> are considered. This means that the matching
can be modified by changing <code>'</code> to <code>`</code>. Only space,
dash, and underscore denote new words so, by modifying the apostrophe, the two
sides will be checked together. For example, changing <code>pickin'</code> to
<code>pickin`[g]</code> causes it to be matched as <code>picking</code>. When a
word isn't recognized, its meter is marked as a <code>?</code>. To change this,
denote the correct stress pattern at the end of the word inside curly braces,
using <code>*</code> instead of <code>X</code> to represent a unstressed
syllable (eg <code>pickin'{/*}</code>).
